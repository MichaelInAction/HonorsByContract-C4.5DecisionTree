Michael,

This is a nice implementation of C4.5.
Overall good job.

Here are a few observations:
- it does not fully follow the style guidelines (indentation, headers, etc.)
- using type String for direction may not be the best way of doing it
- an actual dataset would be cool to have on your repo if you want to show this
  to the world :)

Peace,
